# odin-css-project
Project for the Css foundations course from Project Odin

I'm writing that just now, but firstly I copied the style from odin and after that, I styled it with something that I like, which is gardening.

Since I own a wordpress gardening blog, I used a few things that I learned in the process, which it was consider the size and the extension of the pictures used.

Now, about the project itself. I really enjoyed the challenge and I think that I've learned a feel things about flexbox and positioning things on the page. I know it's not professional, but I liked the outcome!
